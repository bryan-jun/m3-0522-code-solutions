User can sign up

The user enters in a Username and Password into the client and clicks register, which then prompts the server to create a row in the database with
the Username and a hashed password generated from the password entered using Argon2 using the post call for sign-up.

User can sign in

The user enters in an already created Username and Password into the fields and clicks log in. The client checks against the database through the server sign-in post call
to see if the username and hashedpassword pair matches the one entered. If the verification works (and the pairing exists in the database), the token and the payload are
posted and the user is authorized to enter the home page.

User can stay signed in

The client's "user" state in app.jsx is filled with the user that's signed in and remains so as long as the client does not receive a sign-out handler.
Because the user state is not null, it remains in the Rick-Roll home page.

User can sign out

When a user is signed in (the user state is filled with a name), the nav bar refreshes to have a sign-out button instead of the sign-in / sign-up.
Clicking sign out sets the user state to be null, which then prompts the client to revert back to the sign-in page and allows for new server calls
of sign-up and sign-in to be called. The hash token is also removed so that a new one can be set for other sign-ins.
